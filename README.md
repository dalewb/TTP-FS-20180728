# Stock Portfolio App

## About

This is a stock portfolio app tha allows a user to look up different publicly traded companies and buy shares.  The app is dynamic, and updates in real time so that the user can see their performance.  Starting with a mock account balance of $5,000, the user can buy any combination of stock amount and companies to see how they would perform!
